# SunBear
For solar hackathon. April 18 2015.





This project was a one day hackathon done in April 2015.


Outcome:
A substantial amount of the data piping (gathering data) was completed in the backend, the beginning of a frontend was built from another project (TopoE) as a skeleton -- but there was not enough time for the calculations and frontend development. Classic case of over-scoping for a hackathon project. Repo remains for the potential future use of team members.
